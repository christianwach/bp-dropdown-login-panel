# BuddyPress Dropdown Login Panel #

This is a fork of the seemingly-abandoned [BuddyPress Sliding Login Panel](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-sliding-login-panel/) written by [Sarah Gooding](https://profiles.wordpress.org/pollyplummer/).

*BuddyPress Dropdown Login Panel* offers a simple login experience for BuddyPress users. It also includes an account centre with a set of links to commonly-accessed BuddyPress features for logged-in users.

The plugin adds a tab to the top of the page which slides down to reveal a panel where the user can login. For logged-in users, this is replaced by a BuddyPress profile and account preview centre featuring teasers of new messages and friend requests as well as links to quickly navigate to other areas of the site.
