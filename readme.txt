Adds a dropdown login panel to BuddyPress with a full account centre for logged in users.



== Description ==

This is a fork of the seemingly-abandoned [BuddyPress Sliding Login Panel](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-sliding-login-panel/) written by [Sarah Gooding](https://profiles.wordpress.org/pollyplummer/).

BuddyPress Dropdown Login Panel delivers a simple login experience for BuddyPress users. It also includes an account centre with a comprehensive set of links to commonly-accessed BuddyPress features for logged-in users.

The plugin adds a tab to the top of the page to pull down a panel where the user can login. For logged-in users, this is replaced by a BuddyPress profile and account preview centre featuring teasers of new messages and friend requests as well as links to quickly navigate to other areas of the site.



== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to the plugins directory.
1. Activate the plugin.
1. Ensure that the `bp_before_header` action is present in your theme header.
1. You're done!
